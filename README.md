# EDA-Data-Online-Retails
This project demonstrates Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Online Retail II dataset using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib). The dataset contains over 500,000 transaction records from a UK-based online gift retailer, including invoice details, product information, and customer demographics.
# Objectives
- Explore and clean raw Excel data (multiple sheets) using pandas
- Handle missing values, duplicated rows, and negative quantities (returns)
- Detect and visualize outliers using IQR and Z-Score methods
- Answer key business questions, such as:
  - “How many transactions occurred in Germany?”
  - “What are the top 10 best-selling products?”
  - “Which countries generate the highest revenue?”
